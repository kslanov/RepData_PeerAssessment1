## Loading libraries

The first step is to load all the necessary libraries to run code


```r
library(dplyr)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'dplyr'
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
## 
##     filter, lag
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
```

```r
library(stringr)
library(reshape2)
library(chron)
```

```
## NOTE: The default cutoff when expanding a 2-digit year
## to a 4-digit year will change from 30 to 69 by Aug 2020
## (as for Date and POSIXct in base R.)
```

```r
library(data.table)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'data.table'
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:reshape2':
## 
##     dcast, melt
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:dplyr':
## 
##     between, first, last
```

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'gridExtra'
```

```
## The following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':
## 
##     combine
```

```r
library(lattice)
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
